### Clerk Verification Window countdown
Added a countdown section to the **Statewide Threshold** card showing working days remaining until the March 9 clerk verification deadline. Includes a green/red progress bar spanning Feb 15–Mar 9 so you can see at a glance how much of the verification window has elapsed.

### District map boundary improvements
District boundaries on the heatmap are now clearly defined with dark contrasting borders and thicker strokes, eliminating the "green blob" effect where adjacent same-tier districts blended together. District number labels now use proper polygon centroid placement instead of bounding-box center, so labels sit more accurately inside irregularly shaped districts.
