name: Build and Deploy (no data pipeline)

# Triggers on any push to main that is NOT a data-only update.
# This lets frontend/model changes ship immediately without needing
# a new xlsx file.  The data pipeline (fetch.yml) handles data updates
# separately via its own cron + push triggers.

      - 'data/**'            # data pipeline handles these via fetch.yml
      - 'public/data.json'   # written by process.py; fetch.yml deploys after data runs
      - 'public/lookup.json' # written by process.py; fetch.yml deploys after data runs
      - 'instructions/**'    # gitignored; should never reach CI
      - '*.md'               # docs-only changes don't need a deploy
